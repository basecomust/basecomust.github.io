	<h3 style="color: red">VucicBot</h3>
	<div><span style="font-size: 0.6em"> (See <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar Vučić" class="commiehyperlink">Wikipedia</a> for the actual Aleksandar Vucic, whom we do not support by the way.)</span><br>
	VucicBot is a Discord bot created by [[REDACTED]] for the <b>Base Comust</b> server.</div>
	<div>It survived 3 complete deaths, several partial and over 5 revivals. It is currently in active development, although work on it is largely hindered by this website. For intellectuals and those willing to interact with the bot (primarily <b>vaf</b>), we provide an <a href="./api" class="commiehyperlink">API</a> section.</div>
	<h4 style="color: red">A brief history</h4>
	<div>VucicBot was born on the 30th of May, 2022, after Vafelkis prompted me to create a coordinate bot to match
	Systematic, which has since been discontinued and replaced by superior bots, and I've chosen Vucic because of a
	funny map I saw earlier on that month, don't ask. (TODO: link the actual fucking map so this makes sense)</div>
	<div>From May to September, Vucic has greatly developed and inherited a lot of features from the previous bots
	of its owner. After the loss of interest in Base Comust and growing hatred of communism of both its founders,
	Vucic was temporarily discontinued, with brief minor revivals in 2023, and the next actual major revival was
	in September of 2024, as the bot unexpectedly hit its peak and started introducing features like economy and voice
	channel support, expanding what was prior a miscellaneous meme Discord bot. In 2025, the bot received far less updates than in late 2024, however it's still not considered officially discontinued and will likely keep getting
	updates, although currently this website somehow gets more development than the actual bot.</div>
